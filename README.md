# pos-tagger
THis repository is extension of my research on POS Tagging for SUT in Kyiv
with BiLSTM-CNN-CRF.

The system is **easy to use**, optimized for **high performance**, and highly **configurable**.

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.6 - lower versions of Python do not work
* AllenNLP 0.5.1 - to compute the ELMo representations
* Keras 2.2.0 - For the creation of BiLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture
* Tensorflow 1.8.0 - As backend for Keras (other backends are untested.

**Note:** This implementation might be incompatible with different (e.g. more recent) versions of the frameworks. So use versions mentioned above.
